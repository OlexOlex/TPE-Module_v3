# TPE-Module v3

### This is be the reworked (but still not finished) third version of the TPE-Module. ###

**A simple, small, cheap and relatively easy to build module to control 6 outputs freely configurable as dimming (PWM) output, binary (on/off) output or pulse output via WIFI and a webinterface** (designed for controlling vibrators and other custom modules, especially in BDSM play)
Features:

Runs on any newer ESP8266 module running NodeMCU (the ones with more RAM than the first version, usually featuring 4MB flash. 512MB flash is critically small)


## Features:
* Provides a **WIFI-accesspoint** and/or **connects to a (list of) WIFI(s)**, e.g. control it via your home WIFI or outside via the accesspoint or your phones' accesspoint.
* **Control via web page / web app**, works in virtually any modern browser on any system, as long as it's in the same network (Tested on linux and Android, only Windows seems to make trouble) - you can also control it with anything that can send HTTP-POST request, e.g. with curl or wget from a linux server, e.g. in a cronjob or bash-/shellscript on a Raspberry Pi
* **No need for a dedicated app**, call the webpage from the private browsing window of your business cell phone and no traces are left, "Is my platform supported?" is answered by "If it has a browser and network access, most probably yes"
* Controls up to **six outputs at LiPo-battery voltage (3,6-4.2V)** to control any peripherial device by dimming in 1024 steps (though the lower 150 are usually useless for vibrators), by turning it on/off or by a short pulse.
* **User management** enables you to handle three or four different user types: "admin"s can do everything, "basic" can view the current state of the module and control the outputs, "viewer"s can only see the current state of the module. The fourth user group would be unauthorized/not logged in users. Each user is identified by the name and has a role and a password he can change.
* Supports many **custom sequences for PWM outputs** Each sequence is a file in the filesystem with a simple and easy format, available sequence files are autodetected on boot. Name these files as you want the sequences to be shown in the drop down menus.
* Runs at least for **13 hours idling** (WIFI acesspoint running, one client connected, simultaniously connected to a WIFI network, a few website requests, GPS off) with a 3,7V 1200mAh LiPo battery (uses approx. 90mA in idle). Without a client connected to the accesspoint, it runs over 14 hours. It **lasts longer than 30 hours** idling when it does not provide an accesspoint and GPS is off. Charge it for approximately 1.5 hours at 5V, 1A and you are good to go again. GPS enabled draws approximately additional 50mA, power draw on the outputs depends on the connected devise and the PWM ratio used.
* Turns on on 1 sec button press, you can **turn it off on the website only when logged in as admin** - or customize the hardware by using a switch to turn it on and off.
* **Local file server** to upload and manage the files on the module
* **Custom webapp possible** since the module serves any web page or web application you upload and configure (any file named "public[...]" will be served without login-checks). The web app provided includes a custom file to provide information about the module or the wearer.
* See the **GPS position**, or disable GPS for power saving
* **Firmare update via upload** - upload the desired firmware binary file, then provide the hash sum for the device to chekc the file before updating.
* "Turn all off" as some kind of "emergency off"
* **86x51x21,5mm** in size - smaller than a pack of cigaretts. Depending on your skills and the features you want your module to have, you can build it in different cases.
* **Status page** that shows you (roughly!) the current battery voltage and lets you turn off the module (with a voltage divider of 1.5k Ohm to 4.7k Ohm and a multiplication by 4 (as shown/done in the files) below a measured supply voltage of 3000mV the battery will drain quickly (10-15 minutes remain with a 1.5Ah LiPo cell)
* **Configurable to not answer or show a dummy/decoy page on a request to [hostname]/** so if someone gets the IP from the router he will not be presented the main page
* Many options to configure the device behaviour
* Access it in the local network at its IP, http://[your configured servername here] or its default "ESP-XXXXX" name if the registering of the host name did not work, or http://192.168.4.1 if your device is connected to the modules' accesspoint
* Sockets provide ground, battery voltage and the signal (on = tied to ground, max 0.5A each, max ~3A alltogether until the battery protection turns off power. off = no potential) when the module is turned on, so you can permanently **power external modules/cirquits if needed**, or **run a motor directly** between the signal line and the battery voltage line
* Charge it with a common **micro USB** cable
* **Noncommercially open source** - details see Licence.txt (tl;dr: No guarantees on anything, use at your own risk, if you think it's good, buy me a beer when we meet or be a good guy in general. In case you want to use it commercially, contact me and we'll find an agreement)
* Material cost: **approximately 18â‚¬** for me when buying the stuff in China.
* **Relatively easy to build, most parts are premanufactured ready-to-use-modules**, the connectors are common 3.5mm stereo jacks
* Any 3-4V vibrating device with a remote control on a cable can easily be converted to fit this module (if you solder a socket to the original remote control, you can still use the device with the original remote control)
* First time you flashed your module? If you use linux, use the provided upload script for initial file upload (Webapp files that make it more comfortable to configure the first user and uploads demo sequence files as well) or adapt it to a powershell script.
* If no admin user is configured, any login credentials are temporarily acceppted

### Disadvantages:
* It sometimes takes a while until the router knows the device under its configured name, so it might take some time until you can access it at http://[your configured servername here]
* The larger a file is, the longer it takes to load. So keep your web app small.

### Minor "not as perfect as it could be" properties:
* the ESP8266 Module does only support at maximum 4 client devices connected to its WIFI accesspoint
* The requests to the module are unencrypted HTTP-POST requests - no ssl encryption possible
* Web app optimized for mobile phone screen size
* No password hashing (could be read by flashing a custom firmware, that reads all files)
* Remote controlling via requests to a remote server url do not work any more since the library handling HTTPS requests changed
* Rules do not work yet, so geoppfencing and other things like reacting on low or full battery states is not possible
* File upload not perfectly secure


## Material used for this "full feature" Model:
Detailed information and sample links to the product pages of some online shops are provided in an OpenOffice spreadsheet in the "Hardware" directory. (I got most of it on Aliexpress, Ebay, Amazon and other sources might work as well)
* ESP8266 module ESP-12 (or ESP-12E / ESP-12F) 
* TP4056 micro-USB LiPo charging board with overcurrent and undervoltage protection (not just safe charging but safe discharging as well)
* ULN2003A chip or module for driving the outputs
* AMS1117 3.3V 800mA voltage regulator (yes, the cheap ones might only reach 2.9V on a close-to-empty battery, but the module runs even with 2.4V, so any cheap one will suffice)
* 3,7V single cell LiPo battery (without any further protection circuit) 62,8mm x 30,3mm x 7,3mm 1200mAh
* ABS plastic box 86x50x21,5mm (or 85x50x21,5mm according to other vendors) or similar
* Button (pus = on, no push = off), a self adhesive foil type can be fittet anywhere on the outside of the chassis
* 6 sockets for 3.5mm stereo audio jacks - use the threaded ones, they are better for glueing to the chassis and can be screwed to the chassis when you drill the outer half of the mounting hole with a larger drill
* Resistors (7x 4,7kOhm, 2x 1,5kOhm)
* 1 Diode (Germanium, silicon may result in a higher voltage drop)
* Cables (a few thicker ones for the main power, thinner ones for the signals)
* 1 N-Channel (MOS)FET transistor (I used an AOD407)
* 1 NPN Transistor (used one of the primitive BC108 ones, but likely any one turning on at 3.3V or lower will work)
* Additionally you might want dust covers for the micro-USB port and the sockets, a "prototyping" pcb (no breadboard) and shrinking tube might be useful as well
* a GPS module, e.g. uBlox NEO6 or NEO7 and a FET for controlling its power supply
* For building a small bullet vibrator, a common mobile phone vibration motor, some case and a 2 or three wire cable featuring a 3.5mm stereo audio jack (if you use a common audio cable, red and white / left and right are battery voltage and Signal)

### Tools needed for the module as shown above:
* A soldering iron and some solder wire
* A side cutter or strong scissors for cutting wires, a wire stripper might be handy, too.
* An electric drilling machine (a vertical drilling machine is even more useful)
* A 5mm steel drill for drilling the holes for the 3,5mm sockets to stick through the case, optionally an 8mm steel drill to widen the front of the holes to screw the nuts to the sockets
* A 4mm drill and/or milling cutter for drilling the holes for the micro-USB socket (multiple holes next to each other becoming a slot)
* A file for cleaning the hole for the micro-USB socket
* Waterproof glue and hot glue or similar, to glue the components safely together and to the case (two component resin or silicon might work as well)
* Something to measure and mark where to drill the holes in the case



**Development environment**: Arduino  
**Libraries used** (might not be a complete list): Arduino standard libraries for ESP8266, ESP8266WiFi.h, ESP8266WebServer.h, FS.h, NTPClient.h, WiFiUDP.h, DNSServer.h, ArduinoOTA.h, ESP8266mDNS.h


#### Notes ####
This project uses a slightly modified version of the NTP client library to set the time using GPS if available. Changes done can be seen in customchanges_NTPClient.txt  
Don't use GPS anyway? Disable it simply by replacing the code in setTimeFromGPS() by "return;" to make it return immediately. 

### Disclaimer and License ###
This project is a hobby project thet grew over time, I cannot guarantee anything but that I had no bad intentions when writing this (does not do damage on my purpose), but it's "as is", use at your own risk, there are flaws and even thou I tested it regularly there are probably bugs in it.
